# Reviewed Python Service Binding input

`manifest.json` and `upload.multipart` are original cf `workers versions create
--prebuilt` output captured from a fresh official PyWrangler build. `pylock.toml`
records the actual dependency resolution. The build uses the already authorized
Emscripten Python interpreter; cf uploaded only to an authenticated loopback
fixture. The SDK is unmodified, with no synthesized builder or replacement bridge.

The 2026-10-04 capture retains 30 modules. Its original multipart SHA-256 is
`6c94defe5c823eb11c0fa669f2a5d3c75ebcdd79fda9019ebbf77d76994ef3a6`.
All 19 SDK source MIME/size/digests match the shared
[`sdk-inventory.json`](../python-main/sdk-inventory.json); main source bytes match
[`src/main.py`](../../applications/python-services/src/main.py). The lock fixes
SDK 1.9.2 and its wheel SHA-256
`f928e20afddaaf01f216b3ced8884ca1e7675681bb44692add753317fc9ce89d`.
Metadata preserves default/named Worker exports and the two declared Service
bindings. The product case changes only isolated test binding values.

Build/capture evidence is retained under `.temp/p21-python-services/`. The
complete ordinary daemon case passed in `20261005T004230-800b724a`
(257.47 seconds, 1 pass/0 ignored). The registered case also passed in complete
workspace coverage. Final uninstrumented acceptance is recorded separately. Regeneration uses a fresh `.temp/`
copy of the maintained application and `prepare-python-main.ts` with its third
argument `services`. Review original bytes, all SDK hashes and lock provenance
before retaining new input. Never overwrite failure evidence or fork the SDK.
